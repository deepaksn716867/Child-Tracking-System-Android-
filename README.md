Child-Tracking-System-Android-
==============================
The “CHILD MONITORING SYSTEM”, essentially software that allows parents to monitor their child’s cell phone. All call information's and messages can be seen and monitored by the parents. The parents can monitor where their child are (through GPS), and the latitude and longitude values are periodically updated in the cloud Database. Our aim is to develop an efficient and improved geographical asset tracking solution and conserve valuable mobile resources by dynamically adapting the tracking scheme by means of context-aware personalized route learning techniques. The alerts are also stored in the centralized server like the details of incoming call, text and multimedia messages and the timely location update of their children. Parents may later login into the centralized server and view the details of their child’s mobile usage.
